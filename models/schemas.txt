While I couldn't implement the database because of limited time, I laid out this folder to explain the 
project structure. A models folder can centralize schemas required for the inventory managment system and 
can be further broken down into more folders for organizational purposes under the case that more data 
management is required when scaling the app.

a quick example would be...

const ItemSchema = new mongoose.schema({
  name: {
    string: String,
    required: [true, 'Item name required'],
    ... so on
  },
  description: {

  },
  ...so on
})

module.exports = mongoose.models.Item || mongoose.model('Item', ItemSchema)
