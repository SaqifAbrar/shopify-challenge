### Image Optimization
I spent some time to optimize the image, shrinking down file size making the app feel more responsive, quicker and less data demanding for all the requests

## Backend Challenge Notes
1. Please use Google Chrome for the best experience possible. Due to time constraints, front-end component logic is a little rushed.
2. A database was not used (also for time constraints) and I used [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) as a mock database for CRUD functionality
3. You may have to refresh upon entering the backend challenge for the items to render
4. You may have to press the CSV button a few times. It will prompt you to download a CSV file, but it may open new tabs so please press it again.
5. The folders you should view is /pages/api, /pages/backend, and /modules/backend

### I'm very sorry I could not give you a polished experience, but I do believe that I've made this with a design oriented approach, for the project architecture, API and the frontend design
