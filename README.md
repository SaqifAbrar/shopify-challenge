### Image Optimization
I spent some time to optimize the image, shrinking down file size making the app feel more responsive, quicker and less data demanding for all the requests

### Additional Notes

1. Due to time constraints, I was not able to implement the mobile design. The only responsive aspect is font and image sizing. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience :(
2. I also included the backend in the website. It made viewing the backend components much easier as I created global styling with Sass which made it easier to expand and create more consistent elements;

## Backend Challenge Notes

1. Please use Google Chrome for the best experience possible. Due to time constraints, front-end component logic is a little rushed.
2. A database was not used (also for time constraints) and I used [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) as a mock database for CRUD functionality
3. You may have to refresh upon entering the backend challenge for the items to render
4. You may have to press the CSV button a few times. It will prompt you to download a CSV file, but it may open new tabs so please press it again.
5. The folders you should view is /pages/api, /pages/backend, and /modules/backend

## Final Message
### I'm very sorry I could not give you a polished experience, but I do believe that I've made this with a design oriented approach, for the project architecture, API and the frontend design. I hope you enjoy it and have a fantastic day :)
